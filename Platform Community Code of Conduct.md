# Code of Conduct

## Purpose
A primary goal of Miro is to be inclusive to the largest number of participants, with the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible. As such, we are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all— regardless of gender, sexual orientation, ability, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and religion (or lack thereof).

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended – a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our Miro platform community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. Your participation here is also subject to the [Miro Community Guidelines](https://community.miro.com/community-welcome-guide-14/miro-community-guidelines-28) and the [Miro Terms of Use](https://community.miro.com/site/terms).

We invite all those who participate in Miro platform activities to help us create safe and positive experiences for everyone.

## Creating a Welcoming and Inclusive Culture
Communities mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.

If you see someone who is making an extra effort to ensure our community is welcoming and friendly, and encourages all participants to contribute to the fullest extent, please recognize their efforts.

## Expected Behavior
The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:
+ Be friendly and patient.
+ Be welcoming. We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
+ Be respectful. This is a welcoming community of users and developers— and most importantly, human beings— and we must make it a priority to keep this community a safe space where everyone feels comfortable.
Do not insult or put down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior are not acceptable. This includes, but is not limited to:
  + Violent threats or language directed against another person.
  + Discriminatory jokes and language.
  + Posting inappropriate or NSFW content.
  + Posting (or threatening to post) other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  + Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  + Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.
+ Miro reserves the right to delete excessive self-promotional or commercial posts.
+ Content that has been identified as objectionable, inappropriate, or off-topic will be subject to deletion by the Miro team. Posters will receive a warning and risk being blocked from the channel if unacceptable behavior persists.

Any decisions about unacceptable behavior are made by Miro in its sole discretion.

## Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior
Unacceptable behavior from any community member will not be tolerated.
Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.
If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, we may take any action deemed appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning.

## Reporting Guidelines
If you are subject to, or witness, unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify us as soon as possible by [emailing our team](mailto:platform-support+conduct@miro.com).
